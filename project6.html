                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    The major challenge in developing the Sales Analysis Dashboard was dealing with duplicate data and determining the relevance of certain data fields. Initially, the dataset contained numerous duplicates that risked skewing the sales analysis. Moreover, while the dataset included complete date information, the year component was redundant since all entries were from the same year, leading to a need for reassessment on how best to utilize this information.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    To address these challenges, I began by removing all duplicate records in PowerBI to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. After evaluating the usefulness of the date data, I decided to exclude the year data and focused on extracting the month from the date. Using DAX functions in PowerBI, I separated the month to analyze and visualize monthly sales trends more clearly. Additionally, I implemented a DAX measure to calculate total sales and created a custom column for grouping data by age, enhancing the dashboard’s ability to provide meaningful insights into sales patterns across different age groups.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    A significant challenge in this project was using social media data effectively to reveal meaningful insights. Specifically, visualizing social media usage by age group was complex. I struggled with understanding how to create multiple graphs at once, which led me to use a Python script to generate these visualizations.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    As with previous projects, I started by creating a rough layout in Figma. This practice proved invaluable not only for planning the dashboard's structure but also for selecting a color palette. To enhance the effectiveness of the dashboard, I carefully selected the right types of visualizations that best matched the data characteristics. This involved analyzing the data to determine which visual formats would most clearly and effectively convey the key insights, such as using bar charts for demographic comparisons and line graphs for trend analysis. I used Figma’s color picker to ensure the visuals were both appealing and consistent. This methodical approach helped streamline the design phase and allowed me to focus on executing detailed data visualizations in PowerBI.
